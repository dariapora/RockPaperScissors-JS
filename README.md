# Rock Paper Scissors
This repository contains my solution for the [Rock Paper Scissors assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) of TOP Foundations, and it also serves as my introduction to DOM Manipulation. :game_die:

## What I Learned
**Selecting elements** – Used getElementById() to work with buttons, scores, and images.\
**Updating content** – Applied .textContent to display results after each round.\
**Modifying attributes & styles** – Changed image sources and toggled visibility with .style.visibility.\
**Creating elements** – Built a round history using createElement() and .append().\
**Event listeners** – Used addEventListener() to make the game responsive to clicks and hovers.
